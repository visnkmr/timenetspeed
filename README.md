# Please Note:

### Some Android TV/Fire TV OS versions lack the accessibility service option to be able to enable Overlay permission for any app, hence, Unless permission is allowed manually the overlays won't be displayed. 

#### So on these devices the app shows you these details on opening the app unless the permission is granted. In order to manually enable the permission visit: https://visnkmr.github.io/overlay-permission-help
