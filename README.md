# Please Note:

### Some Android TV/Fire TV OS versions lack the accessibility service option to be able to enable Overlay permission for any app, hence, Unless permission is allowed manually the overlays won't be displayed. 
#### So on these devices the app shows you these details on opening the app unless the permission is granted. In order to learn how to enable the permission visit: https://visnkmr.github.io/overlay-permission-help

## Why we made a newer adfree version

Our previous version of Time Netspeed Monitor available on the amazon appstore had gained us huge traction in the initial phases of our app development career. In order to stay loyal to our intial userbase we are releasing this far improved, adfree version which includes Google firebase for crash analytics.
